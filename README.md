# PROG 01: Crunch Time

A tutorial Android application built for assignment PROG 01 of CS260 in Spring 2016.
Crunch Time is a calories conversion APP that accomplished these goals:
1. Allow a user to enter the type of exercise and how many reps/minutes they did. The user should see how many calories they have burned.
2. Allow a user to enter the type of exercise and how many reps/minutes they did. The user should  see the equivalent amount of minutes/reps for any other exercise needed to burn an equivalent amount of calories.
3. Allow a user to enter how many calories they want to burn. The user should be able to see how many reps/minutes of exercises they would need to burn their target amount of calories.

Some basic features of Android development were explored in this assignment.
